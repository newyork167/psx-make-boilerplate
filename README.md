# PSX MAKE BOILERPLATE - PSY-Q

A simple GnuMake setup for the psy-q toolchain. Tested with [GnuMake 3.8](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/make/3.81/make-3.81-bin.zip/download?use_mirror=svwh&download=) located in the installers folder for convenience.

I've included some test code that incorporates using the controller and drawing image updates to the screen.

## Usage

Install the PSX dev toolchain found at [PSXDev.net](https://psxdev.net) / [PSY-Q Install Page](http://www.psxdev.net/help/psyq_install.html). 

Optionally, there is a VM that you can add GNU make to in order to utilize this repository in the [VM Download](http://www.psxdev.net/help/virtual_machine.html) or [Forums](http://www.psxdev.net/forum/index.php) sections.

To run the makefile simply run

```make -f Makefile```
